## Building a Dgraph+Apollo server

That's Dgraph-GraphQL backend, with an Apollo server over the top that removes/hides some of the underlying GraphQL schema and adds some extra functionality.

## Start server 
```sh
npm run start:dev
```

To rebuild the types (e.g. if you edit the schema)
```sh
npm run generate 
```
